The Bootstrap files are copied from the bootstrap repository automatically by /vagrant/build-all.

Do NOT make changes to the Bootstrap files here - if you need to make changes make sure it works via the build process.

However they are checked into git so that this repository/theme can be used via pip install with no extra builds steps.
(As the place the build is happening may not be able to support extra build steps).
